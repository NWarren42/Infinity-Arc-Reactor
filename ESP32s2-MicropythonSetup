''' Setting up Micropython on a ESP32 -- WemosS2 version'''

Grab the binary from https://github.com/wemos/micropython/releases

Put the board in DFU mode by holding the 0 and pressing the RST button 
Check COM port using device manager

run: "esptool --port COMXX erase_flash" to clear whatever garbage is currently on it
run: "esptool --port COMXX --baud 1000000 write_flash -z 0x1000 BINARYPATH" to flash the binary to the controller

press RST (without pressing 0) to pull the system out of DFU mode and into normal operation
** note that the COM port will probably change when switching out of DFU mode **

To connect to the REPL now on the board connect using serial (up to baud rate of 1000000 tested) to the COM port using whatever tool.

Connecting over SimplySerial:
ss -com:XX -baud:1000000 


Connecting over mpremote:
https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html

pip install mpremote

commands: 
"mpremote" -- connects to first available serial device and opens repl by default. Equivalent to "mpremote -repl"
"mpremote connect port:COMXX" -- connects to serial device on specified com port. Shorthand is "mpremote cXX"
"mpremote run <file.py>" -- Runs a script from local filesystem. Prints any output to outside terminal.
"mpremote fs" -- FILE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT!!
